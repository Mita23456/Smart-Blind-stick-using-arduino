# Smart Stick for Blind People Using Arduino UNO and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Description

This repository contains the code and instructions to build a Smart Stick for assisting blind individuals in navigating their surroundings. The project utilizes an Arduino UNO board and an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and provide feedback through a buzzer. This innovative device aims to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection:** The ultrasonic sensor accurately measures distances and detects obstacles in the user's path.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The system provides real-time audio feedback through a buzzer, indicating the proximity of objects.
- **Adjustable Warning Levels:** The buzzer emits different frequencies and durations of sound based on the distance of detected objects.
- **User-Friendly:** The device is designed to be lightweight and easy to handle, providing an additional tool for blind individuals to navigate their environment confidently.

## Components

- Arduino UNO board
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Enclosure (optional)

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code (`smart_stick_code.ino`) to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.
4. Ensure that the connections are secure and the components are functioning properly.
5. Power on the system and test the smart stick's functionality by placing obstacles of varying distances in its path.

## Usage Example

1. Upon powering on the smart stick, it will begin detecting obstacles in the user's vicinity.
2. The buzzer will emit different patterns of sound to indicate the proximity of objects:
   - Slow beeps: Objects are relatively far away.
   - Medium beeps: Objects are at a moderate distance.
   - Rapid beeps: Objects are very close and require immediate attention.
3. Users can adapt to the different sound patterns to gauge the distance and position of obstacles.
4. As the user moves the smart stick, it continuously provides feedback, enabling safer navigation.
